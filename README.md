# Wiki-API
Built my own RESTful Wikipedia like API from scratch using NodeJS, Express and Robo3T

• This API works on the five main HTTP Request Verbs - GET,POST,PUT,PATCH and DELETE 
• The above HTTP requests can be made to Create,Update,Read or Delete the articles from the server
• The app.js serves as the backend server 
• Data is being stored and retrieved from the database called "wikiDB" created on Robo3T ( GUI of MongoDB )
